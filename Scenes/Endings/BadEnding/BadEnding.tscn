text = "You escaped through the escape pod and ran away. little did you know the parasite inside of you was already reproducing and using you as sustanance and eggs
would come out of you through your sweat

You got picked up by a nearby ship that got the escape pods distress signal and you were taken back to earth. on earth the eggs hatched and quickly spread over 
the earth in little under a year.

by being selfish and choosing yourself over everybody else you killed off every human left and the ones that survived turned into mindless zombies controlled by
said parisites.

Game over - Bad ending"
